                 <br> Open Source is an open source software/code accessible to users. Users can use and modify it freely. <br>
						The idea is to have a sharing between users. In the Open Source Culture there is a gathering of programmers and designers. In Cultura Maker, it joins DIY (Do It Yourself) Hacker Culture (focused on programming - Open Source). The objectives of Cultura Maker focus on robotics, 3D printing, software/code, craftsmanship, and especially encourage users who have no experience to reuse designs published on sites/platforms for sharing for creators. </p>

                  "At the same time, new ethical and cultural conventions which became mainstream with Internet communities and Open Source culture are being retroactively applied to the making of non-digital and post-digital media products. ” [8]

					“These events, where people come together to collectively one between shrink-wrapped culture and do-it-yourself culture. The best example of this development (at least among mainstream media) is surely the magazine and website Make, published by O’Reilly since 2005, and instrumental for the foundation of the contemporary ‘maker movement’. Make covers 3D printing, Arduino hardware hacking, fab lab technology, as well as classical DIY and crafts, and hybrids between various ‘new’ and ‘old’ technologies.” [8] </p> 
					
 <p>“When hacker-style and community-centric working methods are no longer specific to ‘digital’ culture (since they are now just as
likely to be found at an ‘analog’ zine fair as in a ‘digital’ computer lab), then the established dichotomy of ‘old’ and ‘new’ media — as synonymous in practice with ‘analog’ and ‘digital’ — becomes obsolete, making way for a new differentiation: one between shrink-
wrapped culture and do-it-yourself culture. The best example of this development (at least among mainstream media) is surely the magazine and website Make, published by O’Reilly
since 2005, and instrumental for the foundation of the contemporary ‘maker movement’. Make covers 3D printing, Arduino hardware
hacking, fab lab technology, as well as classical DIY and crafts, and hybrids between various ‘new’ and ‘old’ technologies.” [8]
