<font size="+1"> This project addresses the issue of crtitical making, the critical production in post digital culture practices. In critical making, by Matt Ratto and Garnet Hertz are directed to design practices that critically involve technology. In Ratto and Hertz's original perspective, the maker movement as its spaces, such as fablabs, hacklabs, digital manufacturing workshops, has become a totally inclusive concept and, therefore, has emancipated itself from this specific context.  

The physical and conceptual creative exploration focuses on using the production of material things to do - as an explicit practice of developing concepts within a social study of technology.

Artistic research as a rule involves practices in which textual and artistic approaches are closely related. In artistic research the researcher writes something about doing/ creating, while the practice informs and completes the writing, obtaining more knowledge.  

Open Source and DIY practices in critical making can be constructively used to question under-reported and little criticized modes of production and distribution in contemporary art.  

And finally, the post digital cultures: Open Source, DIY (Do It Yourself) and Maker. </font>
